1x144 led strip

copy this file to the LEDMatrix_22 library forlder and rename it to LEDMatrix_22.h

This configuration file is for one led strip rather than a matrix.
This is done by setting the horizontel size (x) = 144 leds, and the vertical (y) = 1.
The 1st led is in the top left corner (actually the start of the strip).

The example code Cylon_12.ino is an excellent example fot a single strip.

#include the run_report option in the sketch to see a list of the settings in the serial monitor.
Change the defines as needed for your hardware setup.
