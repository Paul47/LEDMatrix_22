32x32 4x4 tiles zigzag with Extender Shield

copy this file to the LEDMatrix_22 library folder and rename it to LEDMatrix_22.h

LED Strip Extender:
(Please read the manual for details on the LED Extender hardware).
This small hardware shield for Teensy, or as a stand alone PCB for MCUs multiplexes
output pins to drive up to 4 led strips (or 4 sections of a matrix array).
This reduces the number of pins needed to control the array. Why? By reducing the
number of leds in each strip, the quality of the led display is improved. 
For APA102/DOTSTAR leds this can remove display brakedoen while increasing the
total number of addressable leds in the matrix.

This config is set up for 4 extenders, each supporrting 4 leds strips for a total
of 16 strips! In this 32x32 led panel, each 8x8 tile has it's own input wires
support very high transmission and refresh rates.

led matrix:
This configuration file is for 16 8x8 led matrix tiles organized in 4 rows.
The tiles in all rows go from left to right. Within a tile, each row zigzags back and forth.
The 1st led is in the top left corner.
#include the run_report option in the sketch to see a list of the settings in the serial monitor.
Change the defines as needed for your hardware setup.
