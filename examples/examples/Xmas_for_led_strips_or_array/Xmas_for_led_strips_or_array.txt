 * This example has a series of fun patterns for use with LED
 * strips set up as a Christmas lighting display. 

It's designed for led strips but looks nice on led arrays also.

 * You can optionally connect a switch between pin A0 and 5v
 * to control if the Arduino automatically cycles through the
 * different patterns. 

 * You can also optionally connect a button A1 and 5v
 * ground that displays the next pattern in the series
