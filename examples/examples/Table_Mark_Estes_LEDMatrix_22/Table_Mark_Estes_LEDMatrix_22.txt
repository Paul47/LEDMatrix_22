# Table_Mark_Estes_22
Mark Estes' Table code modified (yet again) to work with the LEDMatrix_22 library.
Steps through 113 patterns, and modifies the patterns on following passes.
With this library should be scalable to any size LED matrix panel.
However, not all patterns will be centered in both x and y for non-square panels.

Mods for LEDMatrix_22
Edited the short list to run through more interesting patterns.
Just a few global changes needed for example change class to leds.
Fixed bugs in #8 and #9 that caused lockup
#Table.h
Split out variable and functions definitions to this header for clarity


#Pattern control
Via the Arduino serial port, turn off line endings, and use 'n' and 'p' to change patterns 
or send '80' to jump to pattern 80 directly.

# Table_Mark_Estes (previous version from marc merlin)
Mark Estes' Table code modified to work with just a matrix

#define BESTPATTERNS (Table.h)
Lets you see some of my favourite patterns given that the whole list is otherwise 113 patterns long :)

Below is a demo of that code running on top of SmartMatrix::GFX:
