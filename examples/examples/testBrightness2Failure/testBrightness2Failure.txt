testBrightness2Failure for LEDMatrix_22 library

APA102, DotStar and similar leds, are sensitive to receving data and passing it along a long strip of leds. The maximum limit is a combination of Brightness, speed (spi_Mhz) and frames per second (fps) for the best balance. Use this sketch to find that balance.

Count the number of brightness levels until your matrix panel leds breakup.
Adjust the speed (Mhz) and frames per second (fps) for the best balance.
