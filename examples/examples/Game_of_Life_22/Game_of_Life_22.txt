void setup
  // By default, we use a random game state.  You can comment out
  // the call to setupRandom() and uncomment one of the other
  // calls if you want to see a different pattern used as the
  // initial state.

  //setupGlider(4, 3);
  //setupLightweightSpaceship(4, 3);
  //setupFromXBM();
